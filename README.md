# global-chat-server
Project that uses a server to create chat rooms that multiple clients can use.

## How to run server and client
Type go run main.go in the server folder to run the server file. Optionally you can run the server in a docker container if you wish to do so.

Type go run main.go (ip):3001 in the client folder to run the client file.

After client file is run you will be prompted to enter a username that will be sent to the server. Once the client is connected you may begin talking to other clients.
